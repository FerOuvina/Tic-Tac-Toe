# Tic-Tac-Toe
## The best Tic Tac Toe game on planet Earth.

* In the making of this project I learned more about how to use the hook useState from React.js.
* I also learned about the library use-sound to play a sound when the player wins the game.
* I reinforced my knowledge of localStorage to save the current state of the game.
